### Challenge
Conclusions:

1. When the goals are beyond the range of $15000 to $19999, the successful rate drops significantly and failed rate increases significantly as well. Although the successful rate for the range of $35000 to $39999 and $40000 to $44999 seem high (both 67%, third highest among all ranges), the number of campaigns in these two ranges is too small for the outcomes to be representative. 

2. When the goal is over $45000, the successful rate is extremely low. 

3. Based on the launch date, May had the highest number of successful campaigns and December had the least. It may indicate May can be a good month to launch theater types of campaigns. However, to further understand whether May really is a relatively better month to launch campaigns, we need to compare the total number of campaigns launched in each month and successful percentage in each month. According to the pivot table, there were most campaigns (166 in total) launched in May. This may explain why May had the highest number of successful campaigns. If we further calculate each month’s successful percentage, we can find that May only has slightly higher successful rate (67%). 

Limitations & Suggestions:

1. Continued from above, May has the highest number of successful campaigns and has a slightly higher successful rate. However, success should also be measured based on actual pledged amount. According to the graph showing total pledge amount in each month, the successful campaigns held in September and October generated the most total funding ($634K in Sep and $625K in Oct, while it was just $495K in May) although the number of successful campaigns in Sep and Oct was just about half of the number in May.  It means the average pledged amount of the successful campaigns in Sep and Oct is much higher than that of May.  A graph comparing the average pledged amount in each month can be helpful. Also, since the campaigns in Sep and Oct seem to be the most effective, it’s worthwhile to look into more qualitative details about the successful campaigns held in Sep and Oct to understand what may have contributed to the much higher pledged amount.
